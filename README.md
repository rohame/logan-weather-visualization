# Logan International Airport Weather and Aviation Data Visualization

## Final Deliverables
[See here](#deliverables)

## Data

The data I proposed to visualize are [2016-2018 daily weather report of Logan International Airport](https://gist.github.com/rohame/c26cf5cb80db6520d56fd0921510520b), and [2016-2018 Logan International Airport aviation data](https://gist.github.com/rohame/0141629f53fc311b7b5c68faefda94ef).

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatter plot and it shows the max temperatures across a calendar, colored by precipitation.

Also a scatter plot showing max temperature against min temperature, colored by precipitation.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is the relationship between TMAX and TMIN influenced by precipitation?
 * Are there interesting patterns between TMAX and precipitation?
 * Do extreme weather conditions influence flights? 
 * How is temperature distribution across the year?

## Sketches

The upper part has been delivered in *Prototypes*.

The lower part is a circle marking the mean temperature in a year. Each angle represents a day. The point corresponding to the angle is the temperature of the day. When hovered, the points and lines should reflect the data where the mouse places.

## Interactive Ideas
* Make a menu to filter data of specific intervals
* Make a menu to choose different indice of temperature (snow, precipitation) and flights (cancel, delay)
* Create tooltips to reflect details of each data point

## Open Questions

* ~~Aviation data are needed, but Logan Airport doesn't provide daily flight statistics. Perhaps refer to other airport.~~ Dataset found.
* ~~The "ring chart" is now beyond my capability.~~ Addressed by Professor.

### Features:
* Scatter plot
  * x-axis is days in a year
  * y-axis is the fastest 2-minute wind speed in the day
  * Size of the circles represents the delay caused by weather
  * Color represents the precipitation
* Ring chart
  * Axial dimension is the delay caused by weather
  * Tangential dimension is the days in a year
  * Red means bad weather such as fog, glaze, and smoke
  * Blue means normal weather
* Interactions
  * When the circles are hovered, the color of the circle and the corresponding bar in ring chart will change
  * When the direction of the bar of ring chart is hovered, thecolor of the bar and the corresponding circle in scatter plot will change
  * When circle or bar are hovered, a tooltip indicating the date and delay caused by weather will show up.

## Future Work
* Create a menu to select different y-axises
* Rewrite with React
* Make the code dynamic
* Create a hover effect or menu to select from different years
* Add another axis to the ring chart
